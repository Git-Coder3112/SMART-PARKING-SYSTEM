# SMART PARKING SYSTEM
This is a complete frontend prototype build for our hardware project SMART-PARKING-SYSTEM, allowing our customer to book , check and help physically-abled people.
We built this project to support our hard-ware model we have also thought about differently-abled people who couldn’t carry wheel chairs or handsticks everywhere so we provide them for fixed time on spot.
